# ESP-IDF Button Component

## Features
- Each button can have three different callback functions depending on the time the button is pressed (short, medium and long)
- Debounce algorithm is based on FSM (Finite State Machine), FreeRTOS software timers, FreeRTOS event groups and GPIO interrupts.
- Multiple instances

## How to use
To use this component follow the next steps:

1. Configure the component in the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`)

`
Component config-->Button Configuration
`

2. Include the component header
```c
#include "button.h"
```
3. Create one or more instance of the component
```c
button_t button1;
button_t button2; 
```

4. Define button callback functions
```c
/* Callback function to handle short press of button 1 */
void button1_short_cb_without_argument(void * arg) {
    printf("Button 1 short press");
}

/* Callback function to handle medium press of button 2 */
void button2_medium_cb_with_argument(void * arg) {
    char * string = (char *)arg;
    printf("%s\n", string);
}
```

5. Initialize the component instances
```c
/* Initialize button instances */
ESP_ERROR_CHECK(button_init(&button, /* button instance */
    GPIO_NUM_0, /* GPIO number */
    tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 10, /* button FreeRTOS task priority */
    configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE * 4)); /* button FreeRTOS task stack size */

ESP_ERROR_CHECK(button_init(&button, /* button instance */
    GPIO_NUM_21, /* GPIO number */
    tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 11, /* button FreeRTOS task priority */
    configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE * 4)); /* button FreeRTOS task stack size */
```

6. Register the callback functions defined in 3
```c
 /* Register button1 callback without argument */
button_register_cb(&button1, SHORT_TIME, button1_cb, NULL);
 
 /* Register button2 callbacks for medium and long press time with different arguments */
button_register_cb(&button2, MEDIUM_TIME, button2_cb, "Button 2 medium press");
button_register_cb(&button2, LONG_TIME, button2_cb, "Button 2 long press");
```
